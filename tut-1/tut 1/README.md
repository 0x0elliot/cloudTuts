# Dockerizing an existing app

This is a simple example of how to dockerize an existing app.

### Notes:
- The reason the app built so quick is because I had already built it before. Let it take it's time on it's first build!
- Make sure your docker engine is running! Remember, docker engine is the API your command line `docker` cli speaks to.
